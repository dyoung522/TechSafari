=HEAD1 TechSafari::Reports::Attributes

The .pm modules in this folder are used to reconcile common instance
attributes among the various TechSafari::Reports classes.  Each module is 
implemented as a Moose::Role, and includes the common attribute with any 
methods that are useful* in working with that attribute.
