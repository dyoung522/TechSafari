TS-FtpTools version 0.13
========================

This is a wrapper toolkit for Net::FTP and Net::SCP to allow rapid
development of scripts which require the transfer of files between
two seperate systems via FTP.

It uses a single hash to hold the details (such as username, password
etc.).

It provides the following functions:

    get_ftp - download file(s)

    put_ftp - upload file(s)

    list_ftp - retrives an array of ls -lq from the server

    is_ftp_ready - check remote files (for changes)

In addition, it can read NcFTP bookmark files to identify systems:

    get_bookmarks - reads an NcFTP bookmark file into a hash usable
                    in the functions.

    print_bookmarks - Displays the bookmarks in a human-readable format.

Please See the POD documentation for complete details.
